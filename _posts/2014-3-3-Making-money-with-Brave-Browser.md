To redeem the money, you need a digital wallet called Uphold. This is how we do it.
1. Click on the BAT symbol near the address bar. 
2. Click on 'Verify Account' option. you will be directed to the uphold website. 
3. If you already have an Uphold account, login with that. Else create an account by verifyfing your identity using any official document. 
4. In the Uphold account, add your bank account to which the money to be sent to.
5. Once you accumulate enough , redeem directly to your bank account.

Done!!!

### Pro tip
