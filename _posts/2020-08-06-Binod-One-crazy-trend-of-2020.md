### Binod - One crazy trend of 2020.

If you are someone who is active in the social media, you would already be knowing "The story of Binod".
If you have not heard about Binod, let me tell his story.

### What is going on?
Yes, the question is still loud. Binod has become a sensation in India, rather among Indians. You can find Binod everywhere. You can find him in Twitter, youtube comments, Instagram, Facebook and what not. 

Every random person is commenting Binod and in any comment box visible. This is strange , crazy and you may even call it absurd. It is just as absurd as the human mind. It unlocks the possbilities of having fun in most unimaginable ways.

### How was Binod born?
The first documented appearance of Binod is in the comment box of one the video published by the youtube channel Slayy Point.
The Slayy Point made a video review of the comments they receive for their uploads. And the out of the several crazy comments, they found a comment 'Binod' commented by one Binod Tharu(as per the google display name).
Interestingly Slayy Point published their video review with a title "Why Indian Comments Section is Garbage (BINOD)".

Yes, this is not something new, we see this every single day. People come, read/view and post some random comments, sometimes simply their name.

Now that Slay point has taken up the name, the cyber workers got a new lead , "BINOD".
They simply started commenting Binod. This has become a snow ball. I dont know if Binod Tharu ever knew all these hype after his name :D .

### How big is Binod?

Binod became bigger that someone can possibly imagine is a short span.
1. @PayTM changed its Twitter handle name  to Binod for some time on request from a User.
2. @AirtelIndia asked to receive all the calls with "han bol Binod".
3. @jaipur_police defined Binod to advise people on safe driving , covid guidelines etc.
4. @mumbaipolice used Binod to 	advice the online safety.
5. @nagpurpolice used Binod to adivice to be safe during Corona.
6. People asking to call them Binod.
7. @inder_india matched Binod with Binodini :D .
8. I am Binod. Nam to suna hi hoga.
